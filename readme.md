**Introduction**

This was one of my first attempts at using Spring JPA in anger.  This was part of a small prototype that would use form information, held in a database that could be retrieved through an api and used to build up an Angular data entry form. 

**Technologies**
- Embeded H2 in memory database
- Spring Boot
- Spring JPA
